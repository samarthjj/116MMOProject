# CSE116 MMO Project
##### by Connor Wilson, Samarth Juneja, and Dave Wang

## Overview
This is a very simple game where the only goal is to acquire points, similar to a .io game. If you and another player both enter the same square, whoever has more points will win and claim the points of the opponent. This repository contains networking code to host the game server, as well as local GUI implementation and a version which can be played in the browser.
